### About

This will be a draft copy of a card game I considered making a little while ago in Java. I will use the power of the web to hopefully make it come true! (even if just a little).

Some noteworthy inclusions:

1. Vue Router + Base Configuration
2. TypeScript Support
3. Font Awesome
4. Normalise.css
5. VueLoader
6. Anime JS

### Configuration

1. Change name of folder, `package.json` and `package.json.lock` references `project_template` to the intended name of project.
2. Run `npm install` to download all dependencies

### Running the project
`npm run dev`
